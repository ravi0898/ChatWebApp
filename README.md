I have built the application using javascript framework or library <b><i>React</i></b> as frontend and python framework <b><i>Django</i></b> as backend as well as <b><i>Django-Rest-Framework</i></b> for api because it deals with flawless <i>authentication</i> and <i>serialization</i> of data which supports <b>ORM / non-ORM</b>. I also prefer functional based approach for frontend as well as backend because it allows rooms for customization and facile finding bug<br/>
<br>
Used <b>Figma</b> for creating svg file which shows at beginning for basic animation while loading data. To decode the access token i incorporate jwt-decode dependency which in return providing customized data in the token.

Implemented two approaches for modeling the database that can store,modify and retrive data differently. <i>well it is somewhat inefficient for a chat app to have default database rather <b><i>WebSocket</i></b> would be prime addressing the issue.</i>

I could also use useReducer for state management rather than useState but it was my first this big web application so i didn't want to more complicate it. I did also proper use of useContext. there is one more thing left custome hooks because i had used some of similar functionality so it would have been righteous choice.

<b><i>There is one constrait here that is if the users grows significantly then application may not perform as expected so there is room for data structure and algorithm. well due to time limitation to finishing the project i couldn't do. Obviously binary tree would be satisfactory choice on backend view's functions</i></b>  

<b>The application's specifications</b> :~

&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp; -> User will have privilege chat with anyone whether he/she is registered or not.<br> 
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp; -> If the user is not registered his or her chat will be deleted after 24 hours. ( this is the extra feature i added ) :no_entry_sign:<br>
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp; -> User will have to submitted their name in order to chat if not register.<br> 
&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp; -> If user autheticate themselves then they will get a star on their profile.<br>
